# Peer-graded Assignment: Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set on the course *Getting and Cleaning Data*.

## Review criteria

1. The submitted data set is tidy.
2. The Github repo contains the required scripts.
3.  GitHub contains a code book that modifies and updates the available codebooks with the data to indicate all the variables and summaries calculated, along with units, and any other relevant information.
4. The README that explains the analysis files is clear and understandable.
5. The work submitted for this project is the work of the student who submitted it.

```
Tidy data is formatted in a standard way that facilitates exploration and analysis and works seamlessly with other tidy data tools. Specifically, tidy data
satisfies three conditions: 
1) Each variable forms a column     
2) Each observation forms a row
3) Each type of observational unit forms a table.
```
